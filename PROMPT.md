## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

### Agency Name: **Algan Studio**
### Domain: **algan.id**
### Tagline: *"Smart Digital Solutions. World-Class Execution."*

### Brand Positioning:
The go-to digital partner for ambitious brands who refuse to settle for mediocre. We combine consultancy-level strategy with execution that actually works. Our design doesn't just look expensive—it converts. We're not another agency. We're your unfair advantage.

### Target Audience:
**Primary:** Mid-to-large businesses (Rp 500M - Rp 50B annual revenue) seeking premium digital transformation
**Secondary:** Startups with serious funding (Series A+) needing world-class digital presence
**Tertiary:** International brands entering Indonesian market requiring local expertise with global standards

### Core Value Proposition:
Most agencies talk strategy but deliver mediocrity. Most designers create pretty pixels that don't convert. Most developers build slow, bloated websites. We do all three at world-class level—and we prove it with results, not buzzwords.

## DESIGN SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS - WORLD-CLASS STANDARDS

### Visual Design Language

**Color System - CRITICAL RULE:**
- **NEVER use hardcoded hex colors in component files** (e.g., `color: #1E88E5` is FORBIDDEN)
- **ONLY use CSS custom properties** (e.g., `color: var(--color-primary)`)
- Single source of truth: All colors defined in `src/styles/tokens.css` as design tokens
- Example acceptable usage:
```css
/* ✅ CORRECT - design token */
.button {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
}

/* ❌ WRONG - hardcoded hex */
.button {
  background-color: #3B82F6;
}
```

**Brand Color Palette:**
Based on the reference image (beige/off-white minimal aesthetic):
- **Primary:** Deep charcoal black for headings and CTAs (#0A0A0A)
- **Secondary:** Warm beige/cream for backgrounds (#F5F1E8)
- **Accent:** Subtle earth tone for hover states (#8B7355)
- **Text Primary:** Near-black for body text (#1A1A1A)
- **Text Secondary:** Medium gray for supporting text (#6B6B6B)
- **Success:** Muted green for positive metrics (#2D5F3F)
- **Warning:** Amber for alerts (#D97706)
- **Error:** Deep red for errors (#B91C1C)

**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Satoshi, or custom font)
- **Body:** High-readability sans-serif (e.g., Inter, System UI stack)
- **Accent:** Serif for quotes/testimonials (e.g., Playfair Display, Crimson Pro)
- Fluid typography using `clamp()` for responsive sizing
- Semantic text styles: `--text-display`, `--text-heading-1`, `--text-heading-2`, `--text-body`, `--text-caption`

**Spacing System:**
- Base unit: 4px
- Semantic spacing tokens:
  - `--space-2xs`: 4px
  - `--space-xs`: 8px
  - `--space-sm`: 12px
  - `--space-md`: 16px
  - `--space-lg`: 24px
  - `--space-xl`: 32px
  - `--space-2xl`: 48px
  - `--space-3xl`: 64px
  - `--space-4xl`: 96px
- Never use magic numbers in components

**Layout System:**
- Container max-widths: 1280px for content, 1920px for full-width sections
- Grid system: 12-column for complex layouts, flexbox for simpler layouts
- Responsive breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px - 640px
  - Tablet: 641px - 1024px
  - Desktop: 1025px - 1920px
  - Large Desktop: 1921px+

**Border Radius:**
- `--radius-sm`: 4px (buttons, inputs)
- `--radius-md`: 8px (cards)
- `--radius-lg`: 16px (modals, large cards)
- `--radius-xl`: 24px (hero sections)
- `--radius-full`: 9999px (pills, avatars)

**Shadows:**
- Subtle elevation system (3 levels)
- No heavy drop shadows (modern, minimal aesthetic)

---

### Animation & Interaction Standards - 60FPS MINIMUM

**Performance Target:** All animations must run at 60fps. Zero jank. Lightning fast.

**Animation Principles:**
- **Purposeful:** Every animation serves a function (guide attention, provide feedback, reveal hierarchy)
- **Snappy:** Fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to be perceived
- **Consistent:** Same animation patterns across similar interactions
- **Accessible:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

**Animation Library Strategy:**
- **Primary:** GSAP (GreenSock) for complex scroll-triggered animations, timelines, and orchestrated sequences
- **Secondary:** Framer Motion for React components with complex gesture interactions
- **Tertiary:** Pure CSS animations for simple micro-interactions (hover, focus states)

**Animation Durations:**
- **Fast:** 150ms (button hovers, input focus)
- **Standard:** 300ms (dropdown menus, tooltips)
- **Moderate:** 500ms (modal appearance, page transitions)
- **Slow:** 800ms (hero animations, scroll-triggered reveals)

**Required Animation Types:**

1. **Scroll-Triggered Animations (GSAP ScrollTrigger):**
   - Fade-in sections as they enter viewport
   - Parallax effects on hero images
   - Text reveals (line-by-line, word-by-word)
   - Number counters for stats
   - Progress bars that fill on scroll

2. **Hero Section Animations:**
   - Staggered text reveal on page load
   - Floating/hovering elements with subtle continuous motion
   - Cursor-following effects (magnetic buttons, custom cursor)
   - Video backgrounds with text overlay

3. **Navigation:**
   - Smooth scroll to sections
   - Navbar background blur on scroll
   - Mobile menu slide-in with stagger effect
   - Hover underline animations (grow from center)

4. **Cards & Hover Effects:**
   - Lift on hover (translateY + shadow increase)
   - Image zoom on card hover
   - Gradient shift on hover
   - Icon animations (rotate, scale, path morph)

5. **Page Transitions:**
   - Smooth view transitions (if browser supports) or custom transitions
   - Loading skeleton screens (shimmer effect)
   - Progressive image loading (blur-up effect)

6. **Micro-Interactions:**
   - Button press effect (scale down slightly)
   - Success checkmark animation
   - Form validation feedback (shake on error, checkmark on success)
   - Tooltip fade-in with arrow
   - Ripple effect on click

7. **Advanced Effects:**
   - Text scramble effect on hover (cyberpunk style)
   - Magnetic cursor that attracts to interactive elements
   - Mouse-follow gradient background
   - 3D card tilt on mouse move (for case studies)
   - SVG path drawing animations

**Animation Easing:**
- Use custom cubic-bezier curves for brand personality
- Primary ease: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` (Material Design deceleration)
- Entrance: `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` (sharp entrance)
- Exit: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1)` (sharp exit)
- Bounce: `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)` (playful interactions)

**Haptic Feedback (Mobile):**
- Implement Web Vibration API for tactile feedback on touch interactions
- Use sparingly (only on primary CTAs and important interactions)

---

### UX Requirements - CONVERSION-OPTIMIZED

**Homepage UX Goals:**
- Visitor understands what we do within 3 seconds
- Clear primary CTA above the fold (Book Consultation / See Our Work)

**Navigation UX:**
- Sticky header that shrinks on scroll
- Mega menu for Services (dropdown with icons and descriptions)
- Search functionality (if blog is extensive)
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with smooth slide-in
- Breadcrumbs on deep pages (services, blog posts, case studies)

**CTAs (Call-to-Actions):**
- Primary CTA: High contrast, magnetic hover effect, large click target
- Multiple CTAs per page at strategic scroll points
- CTA copy must be action-oriented (❌ "Learn More" ✅ "Get Your Free Strategy Session")
- WhatsApp floating button (bottom-right) for instant contact

**Forms:**
- Minimal friction (only ask essential fields)
- Inline validation (real-time feedback)
- Success state with celebration animation
- Error state with helpful guidance
- Spam protection (honeypot, reCAPTCHA if necessary)

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton screens (no spinners)
- Progressive image loading
- Optimistic UI (show action success immediately, sync in background)

**Error States:**

- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- `alt` text for all images
- Video captions/transcripts

**Mobile-First Design:**
- Thumb-friendly tap targets (min 48x48px)
- No horizontal scrolling
- Touch gestures (swipe for carousels)
- Mobile performance priority (images optimized, code split)

**SEO Best Practices:**
- Semantic HTML5 structure (header, nav, main, article, section, footer)
- Meta tags on every page (title, description, OG tags, Twitter cards)
- Schema markup (Organization, LocalBusiness, Article, FAQPage)
- XML sitemap auto-generated
- robots.txt configured
- Canonical URLs
- Breadcrumb schema

  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    author: z.string(),
    category: z.enum(['Digital Marketing', 'Web Development', 'Design', 'Case Studies', 'Company News']),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    image: z.string(),
    imageAlt: z.string(),
    featured: z.boolean().default(false),
  }),
});

### Astro Configuration

**Key Configuration Points:**
- Output: `static` (for maximum performance) or `hybrid` if some routes need SSR
- Image optimization: Enabled with quality 80, AVIF/WebP formats
- Prefetch enabled for faster navigation
- Compression enabled for production builds
- Sitemap auto-generated with custom filtering

---

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Image Optimization:**
- Use Astro's `<Image>` component for all images
- Lazy load below-the-fold images
- Serve images in modern formats (AVIF, WebP with fallbacks)
- Responsive images with `srcset` for different screen sizes
- Placeholder blur effect during loading

**Code Splitting:**
- Use Astro islands pattern (zero JS by default, add only where needed)
- React islands for interactive components only (forms, carousels, modals)
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries

**Font Optimization:**
- Self-host fonts (no external requests to Google Fonts)
- Use `font-display: swap` to prevent layout shift
- Subset fonts (Latin only if no international audience)
- Preload critical fonts

**Third-Party Scripts:**
- Load analytics via Partytown (runs in web worker, doesn't block main thread)
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Use facade pattern for embedded content (YouTube, maps)

**CSS Optimization:**
- Purge unused Tailwind classes in production
- Critical CSS inlined in `<head>`
